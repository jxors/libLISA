The `encodings-enumerated.json` file contains all encodings that were enumerated.

The `encodings-correct.json` file contains all encodings for which we were able to learn full and correct semantics. Note that it might include encodings for instructions that use floating point or vector registers. These semantics are only correct for the general-purpose registers and flags modified by the instruction. No semantics are provided for the floating point or vector registers.
